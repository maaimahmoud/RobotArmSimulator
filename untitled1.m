function varargout = untitled1(varargin)
% UNTITLED1 MATLAB code for untitled1.fig
%      UNTITLED1, by itself, creates a new UNTITLED1 or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = UNTITLED1 returns the handle to a new UNTITLED1 or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      UNTITLED1('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in UNTITLED1.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      UNTITLED1('Property','Value',...) creates a new UNTITLED1 or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before untitled1_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to untitled1_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
